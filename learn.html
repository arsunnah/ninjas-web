            <h2>Learn About HTML</h2>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for its appearance.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes,
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
           surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
            do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
            the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to
            display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Learn About CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
                XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.

            <h2>Learn About JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
            <p>JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript
                on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
                browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It
                is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.

                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                History
                Creation at Netscape
                The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible
                to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide
                Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more
                polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13][14]

            <h2>Learn NODE JS</h2>
            <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS,
                and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and
                executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

                Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The
                ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before
                the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
                paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to
                using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

                Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to
                optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as
                for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7]

                The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and
                has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by
                the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]

                Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12] LinkedIn,[13][14]
                Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] SAP,[20] Walmart,[21] Yahoo!,[22] and Amazon Web
                Services.[23]
